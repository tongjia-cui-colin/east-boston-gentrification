## Data Source

The dataset in this folder is compiled from publicly available U.S. Census Bureau data at the census block-group level for East Boston.

The panel includes measures of housing rental costs, income, labor force participation, educational attainment, and public assistance across multiple years. All variables are aggregated, and the dataset contains no individual-level records.

This data is used to support descriptive regression and clustering analyses of neighborhood-level rent dynamics.
